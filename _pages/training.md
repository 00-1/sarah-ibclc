To maintain my IBCLC status, amongst other requirements like minimum hours practice time, I also have to keep a record of my ongoing training. I love learning more, and do not need any encouragement to book onto a new course!

​You can feel confident I am up to date and continually evaluating and assessing my practice so that you can have the most effective support for your family.
