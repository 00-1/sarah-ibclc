## It takes a lot to be an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant.
 
(1000 hours of lactation support experience, 90 hours of lactation education, 14 health sciences/registered healthcare professional, 4 hour exam, 75 hours continuing education to re-certify every 5 years..)

## We're considered the 'gold standard', and support every kind of infant feeding journey.

But it's not really about us. It's about you.

IBCLCs are here for **you** and **your baby**.

Supporting you both as you figure out your way forward together, and cheering you on as you reach your goals, whatever they may be.
